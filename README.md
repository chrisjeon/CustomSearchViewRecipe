# CustomSearchViewRecipe

Android app that showcases how to quickly put together a SearchView with custom pre-filter views by leveraging various different 3rd party libraries.

## Problem
The documentation provided by Google on how to implement a SearchView is lackluster. There are various third party libraries to alleviate this problem and make implementing the SearchView way easier, but customizing the SearchViews are still difficult if the project has specific requirements when it comes to design.

This code recipe will demonstrate one easy/simple way to implement a custom SearchView with custom filter previews

## How to run
Just open the project in Android Studio, build the project, and run it in an emulator.

## Dependencies
- [SugarORM](http://satyan.github.io/sugar/) for caching
- [MaterialSearchView](https://github.com/MiguelCatalan/MaterialSearchView) for instant/easy SearchView
